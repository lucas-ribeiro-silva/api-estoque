# Order and Stock Management API (api-estoque)

This project is a RESTful API built with Java and Spring Boot, designed to simulate the backend logic of an e-commerce or ERP system. It serves as a portfolio project to demonstrate key backend concepts, complex business logic, and database transactional integrity.

This API was developed as a practical exercise for a professional transitioning from a 5-year career in Technical Support (with a focus on ERP systems and SQL) to a Backend Developer / SDET role.

## üöÄ Key Features

* **Full CRUD Operations:** Endpoints for managing `Products` and `Customers`.
* **Complex Business Logic:** A robust order creation process.
* **Transactional Integrity:** Uses `@Transactional` to ensure that an order is only created if all conditions are met (e.g., stock availability). If any part fails, the entire operation is rolled back, preventing data corruption.
* **Real-Time Stock Management:** Automatically deducts product quantity from stock upon a successful order.
* **Custom Exception Handling:** Graceful handling of business rule violations (`InsufficientStockException` - 400 Bad Request) and missing data (`ResourceNotFoundException` - 404 Not Found).
* **Containerized Environment:** A `docker-compose.yml` file is included to instantly provision a `PostgreSQL` database, ensuring a consistent and isolated development environment.

## üö¶ How to Run Locally

### Prerequisites

* Java 17 (JDK)
* Apache Maven
* Docker Desktop (running)

### Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/lucas-ribeiro-silva/api-estoque.git](https://github.com/lucas-ribeiro-silva/api-estoque.git)
    cd api-estoque
    ```

2.  **Start the Database Container:**
    (This will read the `docker-compose.yml` and start the PostgreSQL database in the background)
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

3.  **Run the Spring Boot Application:**
    (Maven will build the project and start the server on `http://localhost:8080`)
    ```bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    ```
    The API is now running and connected to the database.
